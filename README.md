Hello!

These two scripts are for Unity (C#)

Scour the code before checking. These were test scripts for a project.

How to use
1. Attach to the gameobject of choice (all children will fade in or out too, so you can also attach to parent GameObject).
2. On all the materials, the "Rendering Mode" should be set to "Fade" (by default they are set to "opaque").
3. Enabling - disabling the script is how you do it on "Fade In"
4. The Fade Out works by setting the "StartFadeOut" bool to true.
4. Test the speed.


They are not perfect, but they work.

I repeat, these were only test scripts. If you make them better, do not hesitate to send me an email on alkantoros@gmail.com to renew them on GitHub.
